# JsonFileHandler
This is a project that is customized for my non-computer nerd good friend, here is the story:
He is pursuing master's degree in civil engineering. Recently, he is composing his thesis based on analysis on some pictures of some locations during different time in years. The json files were results yielded by machine learning and each json object file is a whole picture after machine learning. I don't really know what the numbers mean in the json objects. He wants such a python script which read each object, group them as for the same location and calculate average of each object's property. For example: assuming we have 8 json files:
0 137_b.jpg.json
0 137_f
0 137_l
0 138_r
