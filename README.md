# JsonFileHandler
This is a customized project for my "non-computer nerd" good friend. Here is the story: He is pursuing a master's degree in civil engineering. He is recently composing his thesis based on analysis of some pictures of some locations during different times in different years. When we were catching up on our life, he mentioned this thesis to me and complained about how much files he had planned to handle. As a programmer, I asked him the details of his task by instinct and instantly came out with this python script idea to automate the process and save him days. There you go here, nothing complicated, but it shows the convenience of a computer program that can bring to our daily lives. The JSON files were results yielded by machine learning, and each JSON object file is a whole picture after machine learning analysis. I don't know what the numbers mean in the JSON objects. He wants such a python script that reads each item, group them for the same location, and calculates each object's property for the same location. Luckily, the file names are well organized for this task, and it's easy to group with minimal effort. The result is then printed onto an excel sheet for charts plotting. This version of the script is the barebone of the project. Later on, he demanded other data calculations and different grouping schemes. I was able to change the barebone script to meet his further requirements.
