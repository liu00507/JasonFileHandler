# JsonFileHandler
This is a project that is customized for my non-computer nerd good friend, here is the story:
He is pursuing master's degree in civil engineering. Recently, he is composing his thesis based on analysis on some pictures of some locations during different times in different years. When we were catching up of our life. He mentioned this thesis to me and complaint how much of calculation he had planned to do to handle these files. As a programmer, I asked him the details of his task by instinct and instantly came out of this python script idea to automate the process and save him days. There you go here, nothing really complicated but it shows the convenience of a computer program can bring to our daily lives. The json files were results yielded by machine learning and each json object file is a whole picture after machine learning. I don't really know what the numbers mean in the json objects. He wants such a python script which read each object, group them for the same location and calculate average of each object's property for the same location. Luckily, the file names are well organized for this task and it's easy to group them with minimal effort. This version of the script is the barebone of the project. Later on, he demanded other data calculation and different grouping scheme. I was able to change the barebone script to meet his further demand.
